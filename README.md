# Medical Appointment No-Show: A Binary Classification Problem
*In development.*

Quick analysis and classification of medical appointments data [taken from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home).

Tasks and goals:
* Data Processing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Feature Engineering.
* Binary Classification to predict No-Shows.
* Performance evaluation using metrics such as recall, precision, AUC and F-score. 
* Classifier comparison.
* Hyperparameter tuning.

To optimize no-show preventive actions, the main focus should be to minimize false negatives, which amounts to maximizing the *recall* (the proportion of positives labelled correctly). This often comes at the cost of misclassifying true negatives as false positives (bad *precision*).
